# Regression Algorithms

Regression is concerned with modeling the relationship between variables that is iteratively refined using a measure of error in the predictions made by the model.

Regression methods are a workhorse of statistics and have been co-opted into statistical machine learning. This may be confusing because we can use regression to refer to the class of problem and the class of algorithm. Really, regression is a process.

The most popular regression algorithms are:
* Ordinary Least Squares Regression (OLSR)
* Linear Regression
* Logistic Regression
* Stepwise Regression
* Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS)
* Locally Estimated Scatterplot Smoothing (LOESS)
